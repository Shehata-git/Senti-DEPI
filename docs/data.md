## How to use it directly in google collab
1. You will need to first get an API key file from kaggle and save it in your google drive.
2. The google drive account containing the API json **must be** the same account used on colab
3. You will use the `SavingKaggleDatasets.ipynb` notebook moving forward, creating the appropriate folders yourself.

Please note that you may need to proof-read before running the code blocks.
