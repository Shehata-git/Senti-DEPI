# Roadmap and progress.
This file contains all the goals of the project and their completion details.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing
- [x] Data Collection: Collect customer feedback data from social media or surveys.  
Commit hash: ffc4fa4d0182be251d34e9c42cba95a8659cc42a

- [x] Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data using Python (e.g., text normalization, removing stop words).  
Commit hash: 25ad22858daa60410785757e8bc9fff4d7b76cf7

## Data Science and Machine learning
- [x] Data Science Analysis: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns in the data.  
Commit hash: 25ad22858daa60410785757e8bc9fff4d7b76cf7

~Build and evaluate sentiment analysis models using Python (Random Forest).~
- [x] Build sentiment analysis model using a pre-trained hugging face model.
Commit hash: Pending.

## Advanced Techniques and Deployment
~Natural Language Processing (NLP): Apply attention-based NLP models to improve sentiment analysis (e.g., BERT).~
Note: Done on previous step.

- [ ] Utilize FastAPI or any similar library to host the model either locally or on a server.

## MLOPs, GANs, and Final Presentation
~MLOps: Use MLflow to track and manage machine-learning models.~
Infeasible under time constaints.

~Generative Models: Implement a basic Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic customer feedback data for analysis.~
Infeasible under time constraints.

- [ ] Final Presentation: Prepare a report and presentation summarizing the project work, including data analysis, model development, and deployment.
